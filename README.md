# recharge-theme-engine
Legacy subscription center codebase from Hint's original customized ReCharge Theme Engine

We shouldn't need this anymore except in the event of a emergency with the new headless subscription center built on top of ReCharge's apis and delivered to our theme via an application proxy.

## In the event of such emergency:
1. Confirm this theme is uploaded and published to ReCharge's theme engine theme editor: https://drinkhint.myshopify.com/admin/apps/shopify-recurring-payments
2. Update the theme settings on the published and/or staging Shopify theme's: https://drinkhint.myshopify.com/admin/themes?channel=true
3. All customers should now be redirected to the original ReCharge theme engine at: `https://www.drinkhint.com/tools/recurring/portal/<customer-hash>/subscriptions`
